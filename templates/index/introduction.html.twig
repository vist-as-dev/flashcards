                                            Are you currently learning a foreign language?
                                            If yes, we have an amazing website that can make the process easier for you.
                                            Our Language Learning Resource helps you create electronic flashcards with foreign words.
                                            The flashcards contain not just translations but also descriptions from a dictionary, synonyms, and usage examples.
                                            This means you get a complete dictionary of the words you need in one file,
                                            ready to be imported into your application for word repetition.

                                        <p>
